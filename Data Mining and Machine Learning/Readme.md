Data Mining and Machine Learning


Coursework Assignment

It is primarily an exercise in applying data mining knowledge and techniques to a practical problem. This assignment involves the analysis of one of the UK's largest collections of UK and international social, economic and population data provided by government departments and agencies, public bodies and local authorities. You are asked to mine the data to help tackle key challenges that many communities face in the UK such as the skills gap, poverty and inequality, discrimination, homelessness, crime, pollution, and health and well-being. You need to provide a journal-type report following the CRISP-DM method and a critical evaluation of possible benefits and commercial risks of the project.


Detailed Specifications

The dataset used for the coursework is based on real-world data sets provided by data published by government departments and agencies, public bodies and local authorities, which are available at https://data.gov.uk/ and https://data.london.gov.uk/ You are asked to use Python to mine the data to discover some interesting patterns of UK to help tackle key challenges which many communities face in UK such as the skills gap, poverty and inequality, discrimination, homelessness, crime, pollution, and health and well-being.

The coursework is divided into two parts which must cover all the stages of the CRISP-DM method:
1.	Business Understanding
2.	Data understanding
3.	Data preparation and exploration
4.	Modelling and model assessment
5.	Evaluation 
6.	Plan for deployment  

For the first part, you need to provide a document containing the mining topic for the coursework, a background on the mining topic, the objectives of the project, and the data sets. This part of the coursework will cover stages 1 and 2 in the CRISP-DM method. This document will be submitted via WebLearn in week 3 and will be assessed by the tutor by week 4.

For the second part of the coursework, you will submit a journal-type report providing details on the whole CRISP-DM cycle and an evaluation of possible benefits and commercial risks of the project. The second part of the project will be submitted via WebLearn on week 12.
