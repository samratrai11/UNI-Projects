MSc Project Guide

School of Computing and Digital Media
(Computer Science and Applied Computing)

The MSc Project is a significant part (60 credits) of your degree programme and it will give you the opportunity to apply the knowledge acquired during the taught elements of the course to current research and commercial problems. 
The aim of this guide is to give you a general overview of the project, and provide useful information on how to carry out the project. You should aim to complete the project on time, and to the highest of professional standards. Contained alongside this module guide is a module specification, an Ethics form, the marking scheme and the grading criteria.

The project may take a variety of forms and it will involve the specification, design, implementation, validation and documentation of a substantial piece of individual application that will fall in areas such as software engineering principles, database development, intelligent system, cyber and network security, mobile computing, data mining, big data, cloud computing, IoT and distributed systems. Projects that involve literature surveys, or empirical field studies, or evaluation of one or more techniques, methods or tools are also acceptable. However, projects that are wholly or mainly literature surveys, or comparative studies based on case studies with no practical outcomes are discouraged. Also you will need to make sure to:
•	Select a subject that you wish to investigate
•	It is vital that you choose a subject that inspires you, motivation is essential. 
•	This is going to be your own independent piece of work so you must be driven from within. Nobody is going to be constantly on your back telling you what to do next. 
•	The bottom line is that you are in charge.

5.1 Report Format
As a general rule, the body of the dissertation should be between 12,000-15,000 words this will normally corresponds to about 40-60 pages if you include some diagrams. We don’t have prescriptive style/format, but students should choose a font that is easy to read (normally 10 or 12) and are encouraged to use one and a half line spacing. You should include appendices for additional material not central to the report (e.g. questionnaires, screenshots) and these will be in addition to 12,000-15,000 pages for the main body.

5.2 Content and Structure
Student’s projects will be assessed primarily from the report and it is therefore essential that it is full account of your work and clearly presented. The detailed structure will depend on the type and nature of the project and students should obtain advice from their supervisors. Supervisors are also expected to comment on outlines and drafts. When writing the report students should make sure to pitch it at the right level. They should not assume that the reader is an expert in a specialist topic that they are reporting, but should assume that they have a good knowledge of the general discipline. If a good fellow student would understand it then that is about right.

All reports should normally have the following elements:
•	Title page
•	Abstract: a summary of the project highlighting major points and describing the project’s scope and conclusions.
•	Acknowledgement: any one student wish to thank.
•	Table of contents: detailed breakdown with chapter headings, section headings and may be subsection headings, each with page numbers.
•	Table of figures: location, number and legend  of all figures in the report
•	References
•	Bibliography (optional)
•	Appendices

Project presentation (viva):
•	Each MSc student will be given a date to present his/her work to the supervisor and a second marker. This usually happens within two weeks from the submission date. The duration of the viva is 30 minutes; students will be given 10-12 minutes to present their work and the remainder will be used for questions and feedback. To provide some guidance, the presentation should contain the following items:
•	-Title slide
•	-Introduction: in one or two slides, you should briefly describe the rationale, motivation, hypothesis and goal/objectives of your work.
•	-Background: provide necessary background reading with some level of criticality; highlight the current trends and the gaps which are formulated as part of your research elements.
•	-Analysis and design: briefly describe how you analysed your requirements and what method you used for designing your functionalities.
•	-Implementation: you should provide and demonstrate full implementation of your software and any other artefacts.

BCS project requirements:
The British Computer Society defines the particular requirements that projects on Computing programmes should meet. These are given below for your information: 
General project requirements: within their curricular projects, students are expected to deliver a good quality project. as outlined above, prior to starting the project and while they are doing their Research and development skills’ module, students are being prepared for the project and their awareness towards the project is raised through a good guidance in terms of projects’ expectation, type and format of project, selection of projects through engaging with tutors and they are run through the assessment criteria mentioned above.

As described above the report should include:
•	Aims and objectives, rationale and elucidation of the problem
•	Evidence of a thorough relevant literature review with criticality
•	Full description of research hypothesis through software or framework architecture.
•	Full justification and choice of appropriate methodology and approach
•	Discussion of results and critical evaluation and appraisal of own work; explaining the rationale behind design and full implementation of functionalities.   
•	 An update to date and relevant references

Postgraduate project requirements: Project at the postgraduate level should be more advanced compared to Undergraduate project; project should contain an in depth investigation of a problem leading to innovative ideas appropriate to a master’s degree.
Postgraduate projects must give students the opportunity to demonstrate;
•	A good knowledge and awareness of current problems and extend this knowledge to new area of application
•	A comprehensive understanding of techniques; apply newly acquired knowledge and techniques to a specific problem using established research techniques and methods.
•	An ability to produce detailed specifications and design frameworks relevant to the problem investigation in the subject related to the industry with originality in the application of new knowledge and skills; good discussion of how results are produced with a detailed interpretation of the acquired knowledge.
•	The subject should be challenging and complex and requires creativity in the field of research
•	Good skills to effectively communicate the work to others including specialists and non-specialist in the field by means of verbal and appropriate documentation techniques. 
•	Demonstrate self-awareness, planning, problem solving, and originality in the application of new knowledge and professional skills.
Critical self-evaluation of the whole process
